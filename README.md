## My process

Worked on Mobile first approach, then added media queries, adjusting the layout.
Used React for building the app using component based approach and Bootstrap for layout.
Split the code into as many reusable components as possible. Can be useful if we have more pages for the site.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology
- SASS
- Bootstrap
- React
- Intersection Observer
- Framer Motion

### What I learned

Improved on creating components for the webpage.
Using framer motion with intersection observer to add small animations to any react site.

### Continued development

Continue focusing more on react and more animation libraries.
